### My deploy a micro-svc appn with redis proj requirement gatherings :

Deploy & break locally first \

```Docker before Kubernetes
Deploy locally before taking things to AWS cloud
Reverse proxy with TLS termination before AWS ALB
Feeling lost means you're learning correctly
I can't skip the foundation!! Devops will be about foundation only.
AI will accelerate debugging, when I already have the context.
```

#### Each Day's Goals: 
26-12-2025
Create docker files for frontend, backend, test connectivity from application to the redis, database. \
Function the application only on Docker locally
Write deployment, kubernetes files run the application on Kubernetes locally. \
